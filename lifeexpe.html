                Rome wasn't built in day
     
   I cannot forget how I managed to adapt to the new environment in America when I newly arrived there. 
   Although I had achieved the required scores in English tests before going abroad, it was still a big 
   challenge for me to study in English in real-world environments, especially in professional courses, 
   which required me to quickly understand all English professional terms and theories that I had contacted 
   little before. At first, closely following teachers in class was difficult for me, who had always been a 
   model student in China. Equally frustrating was that as a person fond of making friends and eager to interact 
   with others, I had no confidence to express my viewpoints in group discussions in fear of being teased by others 
   about my English pronunciation and speed of speaking. Given cultural differences, I was also anxious about saying 
   or doing something that was normal in China but deemed as weird in America. However, there was strong motivation for making 
   changes in me.
